# Loan Default Prediction Using LendingClub Data

This project analyzes and predicts loan repayment behavior using a dataset of over 9,500 loans from [LendingClub.com](https://www.lendingclub.com). It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and an interactive Tableau dashboard.

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### ðŸ”— Correlation Matrix

- `installment` vs `loan.amnt`: Strong positive (~0.97)  
- `fico` vs `int.rate`: Strong negative correlation  
- `not.fully.paid`: Weak linear correlation â†’ non-linear models preferred

###  Histograms by Loan Status

| Feature       | Observation                                |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `int_rate`    | Defaults have higher interest rates        |
| `fico`        | Defaulters have lower FICO scores          |
| `dti`         | Slightly higher for defaulters             |
| `revol_util`  | Higher in defaults                         |

###  Line Plot: Loan Feature Trends by Purpose

This plot shows feature averages by loan `purpose` (only fully paid loans):

- **Small Business Loans**:
  - Higher installments
  - Longer credit histories
  - Higher balances

- **Credit Card / Debt Consolidation**:
  - More consistent, lower-risk borrower profiles

##  Model Training & Evaluation

###  Model: Random Forest Classifier

- Captures non-linear relationships  
- `class_weight='balanced'` to address class imbalance  
- Evaluation optimized for **recall** on defaults

| Metric     | Paid (0) | Default (1) |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| Precision  | 0.97     | 0.95        |
| Recall     | 0.95     | 0.98        |
| F1 Score   | 0.96     | 0.96        |
| Support    | 2419     | 2408        |


###  Key Insights

- Business Objective: Prioritize identifying loans that are likely not to be paid back.

- Overall Accuracy of the Model = 96% â†’ Excellent general performance.

- The model achieved a high recall of 0.98 for Class 1 (Not Fully Paid), meaning it successfully catches nearly all high-risk loans.

- Precision of 0.95 ensures that false positives (flagging a good loan as risky) remain low.

- This balance between recall and precision makes the model highly effective for minimizing financial risk while maintaining lending opportunity.

##  Tools Used

| Tool                      | Purpose                        |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Python**                | Data preprocessing & modeling  |

##  Business Implications

- Credit score, interest rate, and revolving utilization are **strong predictors** of loan default  
- **Small business loans** are riskier â€” even when fully paid, they show elevated indicators  
- **Random Forest** is a robust solution for predicting loan repayment with high accuracy and recall
